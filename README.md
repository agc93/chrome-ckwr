# CK Wiki Redirector

A simple Chrome extension that attempts to automatically redirect navigation to the original Creation Kit Wiki (hosted on creationkit.com) to the clone of the wiki created and maintained by the UESP Project (see https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/CreationKit:Copy_Notice). This should redirect URLs like https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Category:Papyrus to the equivalent page on the UESP site (https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Category:Papyrus).

The extension is available at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fhmgemglejnmihnkilbcmfajmjfnfiag).
